# cloudmqtt-embedded

This is an effort to bring cloudmqtt-core to embedded devices.

For now the goal here is to build a crate that can be used on a rp2040. Patches
for generalizing this are welcome, even if that means that more stuff has to be
implemented on the client-side of this library.

The goal here is to get something done, not to be general.

## State

Do not use. Probably broken and definitively ugly.
